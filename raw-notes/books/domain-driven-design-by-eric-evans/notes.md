## Part one - Putting the domain model to work

> [The] subject area to which [a] user applies [a] program is the domain of the software.

> A model is a simplification. It is an interpretation of reality that abstracts the aspects relevant to solving the problem at hand and ignores extraneous detail.

> A model is a selectively simplified and consciously structured form of knowledge. An appropriate model makes sense of information and focuses it on a problem.

> A **domain model** is not a particular diagram; it is the idea that the diagram conveys. A diagram can represent and communicate a model, as can carefully written code, as can an English sentence.

#### The Utility of a Model in Domain-Driven Design

> The model and the heart of the design shape each other. It is the intimate link between the model and the implementation.

> The model is the backbone of a language used by all team members. Because of the binding of model and implementation, developers can talk about the program in this language.

> The model is distilled knowledge. The model is the team's agreed-upon way of structuring domain knowledge and distinguishing the elements of most interest.
