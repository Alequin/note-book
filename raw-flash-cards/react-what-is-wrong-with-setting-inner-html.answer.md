## What is dangerouslySetInnerHTML?

`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is a prop available on react components for rendering stringified html into your React project

## Why is it discouraged

Setting HTML from code is risky because itâ€™s easy to inadvertently expose your users to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
