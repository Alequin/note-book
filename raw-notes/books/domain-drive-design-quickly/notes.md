# [Domain Drive Design Quickly: A summary of Eric Evans](https://matfrs2.github.io/RS2/predavanja/literatura/Avram%20A,%20Marinescu%20F.%20-%20Domain%20Driven%20Design%20Quickly.pdf)

## Chapter 1 - What Is Domain-Driven Design

> When we begin a software project, we should focus on the
> domain it is operating in. The entire purpose of the software is to
> enhance a specific domain. To be able to do that, the software
> has to fit harmoniously with the domain it has been created for.
> Otherwise it will introduce strain into the domain, provoking
> malfunction, damage, and even wreak chaos.

> How can we make the software fit harmoniously with the
> domain? The best way to do it is to make software a reflection of
> the domain. Software needs to incorporate the core concepts and
> elements of the domain, and to precisely realize the relationships
> between them. Software has to model the domain

> Somebody without knowledge of [of the given domain] should be able to learn
> a lot just by reading the code in a domain model. This is
> essential. Software which does not have its roots planted deeply
> into the domain will not react well to change over time.

> A domain is something
> of this world. We need to create
> an abstraction of the domain. We learn a lot about a domain
> while talking with the domain experts. But this raw knowledge is
> not going to be easily transformed into software constructs,
> unless we build an abstraction of it.
